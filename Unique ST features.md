### Program module and function module are separated
<pre>
programs are split up as follows

-program modules

-Functions

-Function blocks

“A PLC program must be split up into many small program pieces in order to have a good and clear program structure. The small program pieces are called program modules, functions and function blocks, and they each contain a small piece of PLC code and is a building block, to be used or reused whenever needed.
To obtain a good structure, it is a good rule of thumb to only have only 20 - 25 lines of PLC code in each program module, function or function block.”

“The difference between functions and program modules is that functions often perform calculations or data processing on individual components, whilst program modules is the splitting up of the entire program. The program modules use relevant functions and function blocks to solve the specific tasks.”
